# Using real-world images

### ImageDataGenerator

A TensorFlow API that you can point it to a directory of images, and sub-directories of that will automatically generate labels for you.

For example if I point the ImageDataGenerator to the "Training" directory, the labels will be horses and humans, images in each directory will be loaded and labelled accordingly.

<img src="pics/ImageDataGenerator.png" width="500" height='300'>


```py
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image
import ImageDataGenerator

train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255)

train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
  train_dir,
  target_size=(300, 300), # The resolution you want the images to be rescaled
  batch_size=128,
  class_mode='binary'
)
```


### ConvNet for complex images

Let's say we need to train a NN to classify human and horses, they could be in different orientation and sizes.

<img src="pics/human_horses.png" width="500" height='300'>

```py
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(300, 300, 3)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(300, 300, 3)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
  tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(300, 300, 3)),
  tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

- We have 3 sets of Convolution and pooling layer, this reflects the complexity and size of the images.
- We used sigmiod activation function with only 1 neuron, sigmoid is great for binary classification. In theory we can use 2 neurons with softmax activation function, but sigmiod is more efficient for binary classification.


### Adding automatic validation to test accuracy
Building validation data into the training loop by specifying a set of validation images, we need to call `train_datagen.flow_from_directory` again and point it to the directory where validation images are saved.

```py
validation_generator = validation_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        '/Users/lin/data_science/validation-horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for validation images
        target_size=(300, 300),  # All images will be resized to 300x300
        batch_size=32,
        # Since you use binary_crossentropy loss, you need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')
```

The use the `validation_data` argument in `model.fit` to specify where the validation set is saved.

```py
history = model.fit(
      train_generator,
      steps_per_epoch=8,  
      epochs=15,
      verbose=1,
      validation_data = validation_generator,
      validation_steps=8)
```
Then validation accuracy and loss will be computed on each epoch.

### Impact of compressing images
Instead of 300 by 300, now we're changing the input image to 150 by 150 and removing the last 2 convolution layers as below:

Customising the imput image size by changing parameter of the `ImageDataGenerator` class, namely `target_size`.
```py
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator

# All images will be rescaled by 1./255
train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)
validation_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1/255)

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        './horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(150, 150),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=128,
        # Since you used binary_crossentropy loss, you need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')

# Flow training images in batches of 128 using train_datagen generator
validation_generator = validation_datagen.flow_from_directory(
        './validation-horse-or-human/',  # This is the source directory for training images
        target_size=(150, 150),  # All images will be resized to 150x150
        batch_size=32,
        # Since you used binary_crossentropy loss, you need binary labels
        class_mode='binary')
```

```py
import tensorflow as tf

model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    # Note the input shape is the desired size of the image 150x150 with 3 bytes color
    # This is the first convolution
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150, 150, 3)),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2, 2),
    # The second convolution
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    # The third convolution
    tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
#     # The fourth convolution (You can uncomment the 4th and 5th conv layers later to see the effect)
#     tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
#     tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
#     # The fifth convolution
#     tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
#     tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),
    # Flatten the results to feed into a DNN
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
    # 512 neuron hidden layer
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    # Only 1 output neuron. It will contain a value from 0-1 where 0 for 1 class ('horses') and 1 for the other ('humans')
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
```

This is one technique to keep in mind especially when you are still in the exploratory phase of the project. You can see if a smaller model behaves just as well as a large model so you can have faster training. You also saw how easy it is to customise your images for this adjustment in size by simply changing a parameter in the `ImageDataGenerator` class.
